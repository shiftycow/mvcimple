=head1 Name

MVCimple - A simple model-view-controller framework generator for Perl

=head3 Synopsis

mvcimple --generate-app <configuration_file.xml>

=head3 Description

MVCimple is used to automatically generate skeleton code for web 
applications using the Model-View-Controller model. MVCimple is not a 
"framework" in the same sense as Catalyst - it's main purpose is to take a 
configuration file and turn it into I<simple> Perl code that handles the 
Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) functions that take time to write, but 
yet are logically simple. Most importantly, since MVCimple is not a 
framework itself, generated application code can be taken to any server 
that has the dependencies listed below. 

=head3 Dependencies

MVCimple is designed to generate strict applications with a very short list
of dependencies. The following dependencies should be either included in the
standard Perl distribution or be a quick CPAN/apt/yum installation away.

=head4 Models

At the core of any application are the data I<models> that define what data are stored and how they are related to one-another. MVCimple uses XML files to define data models and then automatically generates I<views> and C<Controllers> for them.
