=head3 Description

MVCimple is a lightweight web application framework for Perl.
It's focus is to automate the data side of applications using objects,
and handle the Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) functions easily.

MVCimple is being designed to play nicely with other frameworks like
Mojolicious. It is also designed to be extensible by end users who may
need to override some methods or add datatypes to provide more functionality.

Please note that MVCimple is still under I<heavy> development.
=head3 Dependencies

MVCimple is designed to generate strict applications with a very short list
of dependencies. The following dependencies should be either included in the
standard Perl distribution or be a quick CPAN/apt/yum installation away.

=over 4

=item * L<XML::Simple>

=item * L<CGI>

In addition to Perl dependencies, MVCimple applications rely heavily on
L<Jquery> and L<JqueryUI> for AJAX communication between the browser and
the server.

=head4 App

=head4 Model

At the core of any application are the data I<models> that define what data
are stored and how they are related to one-another. MVCimple uses XML files
to define data models and then automatically generates I<views> and 
C<Controllers> for them.
